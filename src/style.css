/**
 * # Main Stylesheet for Weather Wizard
 *
 * This CSS file defines the visual styling for the GTK widgets in the Weather Wizard
 * application. It uses CSS classes to apply specific styles to labels and images,
 * controlling font sizes, weights, and other visual properties to create a clean
 * and readable user interface.

/*
 * Style for the weather icon/image.
 * This class is applied to the `gtk::Image` widget that displays the weather symbol.
 * Note: The size is primarily controlled by `set_pixel_size` in the Rust code.
 */
.weather-symbol {
    font-size: 80px; /* Fallback size if image is not loaded */
    font-weight: bold;
}

/*
 * Style for the main temperature label.
 * This class makes the temperature reading large and bold, making it the
 * most prominent piece of information in the UI.
 */
.weather-temp {
    font-size: 30px;
    font-weight: bold;
}

/*
 * Style for the weather condition description label (e.g., "broken clouds").
 * This class applies a smaller, italicized font to provide secondary information
 * without distracting from the main temperature reading.
 */
.weather-description {
    font-size: 18px;
    font-style: italic;
}

/* Style for the humidity label. */
.weather-humidity {
